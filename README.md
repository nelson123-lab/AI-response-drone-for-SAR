## Key Features

AIRED has modern functionalities as follows:

- High Payload capacity, versatile, and platform agnostic architecture
  - With the assistance of its six motors, the AIRED can raise up to 5 kg of weight.
- Autopilot
  - AIRED can compute the flying distance and loop across the designated area thanks to the flight controller and Jetson TX2.
- Efficient optimization
  - Swarm formation capability for faster ground coverage
- Quick visualization
  - The AIRED results are transmitted in real time on a monitor alongside GPS coordinates of human detection.

## Motivation
-	Kerala, a state in southern India, reported experiencing its worst flood in nearly a century on August 16, 2018. 
140 individuals remain missing, and over 483 people died. Our project was helpful for search and rescue efforts.

## Implementation
-	Utilizing the HERIDAL dataset, we created a multimodal technique (FPN + Classification) for human identification. 
- We were able to launch a hot drop using our drone's 5 kg of payload (Survival kit).
-	The precision and recall of the experiment were 58.89% and 84.65%, respectively.


This project was recognized as the final nomini in PPTIA Innovation awards.
