## Key Features

AIRED has modern functionalities as follows:

- [High Payload capacity, versatile, and platform agnostic architecture]
  - The AIRED can lift upto 5kg of weight with the help of it's 6 motors.
- [Autopilot]
  - The flight controller along with Jetson TX2 provides it the ability to calculate the flying distance and loop through the alloted region.
- [Efficient optimization algorithms]
  - Adopt state-of-the-art algorithms for sampling hyperparameters and efficiently pruning unpromising trials.
- [Easy parallelization]
  - Scale studies to tens or hundreds or workers with little or no changes to the code.
- [Quick visualization]
  - The results obtained from the AIRED are streamed live in a monitor with the human detection.
